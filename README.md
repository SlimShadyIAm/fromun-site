# FROMUN website

This website was created to be used as the official site for the Froebel's International School Model UN.  Here, students were able to find information regarding the host team staff, scheduling as well as how to register to participate. The final version, tweaked by Rockville, can be found at 
[froebels.edu.pk/fromun](http://froebels.edu.pk/fromun), though it has been modified by students with information from newer years.
