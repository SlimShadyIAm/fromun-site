          <p class="user-intro">Greetings delegates!</p>
          <p class="user-intro">It is my absolute honour and delight to be upholding the post of secretary general in this year’s installment of FROMUN.</p>
          <p class="user-intro">Some of you may be newbies, others well acquainted with the MUN circuit. Well, regardless of your considered status in the MUN world, FROMUN 2016 is an event you really do not want to miss. My team and I plan to provide all you with a unique
            diplomatic experience, exhilarating debate and thrilling socials.</p>
          <p class="user-intro">Putting aside the blatant event publicity for a moment, as far as I myself am concerned; my debating career, now spanned across three and a half years, has consisted of experience in a whole host of MUN’s both on the national and international
            level. Perhaps the most noteworthy would be being awarded with the best speaker award in a simulation of the UNSC at Oxford where I was invited to study debate and public speaking at a summer programme.</p>
          <p class="user-intro">Even though some might consider me as a “lil toughie”, I still remember those first few MUN’s where nothing made sense and all I wanted to do was hide. So, rest assured newbies, I have a soft spot for you and I will try my best to provide you
            with an enjoyable experience.</p>
          <p class="user-intro">So mark your calendars and begin counting down the weeks, days, hours and seconds to FROMUN 2016, because we plan on providing you with remarkable memories you will never let go off.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p class="user-intro">Hello enthusiastic debaters, honourable chairs and even idle observers. My name is Mariam Niazi and you’re lucky enough to have me as your director general for FROMUN 2016.</p>
          <p class="user-intro">To start off, I'd like to introduce myself a bit. I am a passionate and avid partaker in any extracurricular activity, and I have learnt to identify and highlight the positive aspects of any situation or action, allowing myself to also see the
            strengths in one's character and their prowess. Having attended many MUNs, international and national alike, I am able to recognise the diversity, not only present in the event, but also in the participants. Here at FROMUN, we hope to make
            sure every delegate leaves happy and gratified - content with the fact that they made the choice of attending this particular MUN. </p>
          <p class="user-intro">With our wide variety of committees, we have a platform for every type of debater to come and express themselves and their skills. Our esteemed chairs, along with your executive council, who will be there for you every step of the way, are present
            to guide you to the path of excellence in speaking and understanding the ways of the world’s nations - literally. Protocols and systems will always appear in committee rooms. Well, almost always. Anyways...We will help create a coherent learning-and-debating
            environment where new-comers will be made to feel comfortable, and those familiar with the MUN world, will be enabled</p>
          <p class="user-intro">Our host team is been comprised of those who we believe to be the best at what we have appointed them to do, i. e. cater to the needs of delegates. From registering them, to providing pens and paper and putting up the social events, our host
            team is working to their best ability to make this FROMUN the best one yet (and their best ability is very, very, very, very high. We hope).</p>
          <p class="user-intro">Whether you are here for the debates, the social events, or just to witness the MUN unit as an observer, we are building FROMUN 16 to the standard where not a single person will leave the event unsatisfied. </p>
          <p class="user-intro">So be prepared for three days of hard work, or complete slacking off. We hope to see you there!</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p class="user-intro">AOA to all. My name is Arafat Rasheed and it's my pleasure to be the Chief of Staff at the most spectacular event in Islamabad this year, Fromun 2016! A little bit more about me, I'm an 18 year old AS student obsessed with cricket studying Business
            subjects and wanting to pursue a successful career as an entrepreneur! Having been in the MUN circuit for over 4 years now I know my fair deal about such events and fromun this year will be a mixture of everything that's right at an MUN!</p>
          <p class="user-intro">Fromun has made a special name for itself in the MUN circuit. It's the event that provides delegates a platform to showcase their knowledge, ability and diplomacy alongside some energy packed social events making it worthwhile the money all
            of you pay!</p>
          <p class="user-intro">I promise you three days of thrill and excitement! 3 days of intense debate and 3 bodacious and engrossing social events! Not to mention our ever so humorous entertainment sessions! Our social events this year include our Global Village which
            will provide Delegations an opportunity to portray their countries culture by presenting their local cuisines and participating in a ramp walk! Our Formal dinner and Closing Ceremony will provide delegates a scrumptious feast and great accolades
            for our award winners. Fromun 2016 will also provide delegates an opportunity to unwind after committee sessions with our high energy concert! </p>
          <p class="user-intro">If you’re a first timer than fromun is your MUN to attend as we have a highly qualified Secretariat who will guide you at each step of the way! If you are a qualified achiever in the MUN zone then you will enjoy the competitive level of debate!
            Fromun this year will showcase a great diversity of debate from 3 different cities with participants coming in from Islamabad, Lahore and Rawalpindi! With a mix of the usual committees that are present at every MUN like the Security Council,
            Pakistan National Assembly and our very own adaptation of the Historic Crisis Cell Fromun 2016 provides delegates with 9 distinct committees discussing the most complicated and controversial topics going on in the world today! As Chief of
            Staff I can tell you our team is working tirelessly to make Fromun 2016 a major success and to make sure that each and every delegate and observer is facilitated! So join us this November for great food, music and most importantly a debating
            experience of a life time!</p>
